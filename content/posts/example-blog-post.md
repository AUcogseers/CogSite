## This is my thesis statement
### This is a sample blog post
I can write code like this:
``` 
# This is a code block
WriteBlogPost(new DateTime(DateTime.now()));
```
...though I might want to write other stuff as well. Maybe even [link to some cool stuff](https://github.com/AUcogseers/CogSite/tree/master/content). Or possibly have an image in my cool blog post:

But there's also just these normal awesome text formatting things:
- [x] *This is italicized*
- [x] **This is something else**
- [ ] Oh my, there's also a list in the middle of it all
- [ ] with checkmarks!
### Here's another major point
But I never planned this far so maybe I'll just link to the [markdown post...](writing-in-markdown)
