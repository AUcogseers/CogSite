## Notes on preliminary approval and examples of certificates

Getting preliminary approval for these courses does not seem to be possible. If it becomes possible in the future, these ECTS calculations might be relevant.

The ECTS equivalent is calculated using the equation 1 ECTS = 28 hours (as per
AU regulations) of course workload. Sending in these one-pagers for approval
should be enough.

Examples of certificates:

# Machine Learning with Python: from Linear Models to Deep Learning (eligible)

- Instructor: [MIT (Massachusetts Institute of
  Technology)](https://www.mit.edu/)
- Publisher: [EdX](https://www.edx.org/)
- Link:
  <https://www.edx.org/course/machine-learning-with-python-from-linear-models-to>
- Price: \$300
- Time: 10-14 hours / week, 14 weeks, 196 hours, 7 ECTS

Machine learning methods are commonly used across engineering and sciences, from
computer systems to physics. Moreover, commercial sites such as search engines,
recommender systems (e.g., Netflix, Amazon), advertisers, and financial
institutions employ machine learning algorithms for content recommendation,
predicting customer behavior, compliance, or risk.

As a discipline, machine learning tries to design and understand computer
programs that learn from experience for the purpose of prediction or control.

In this course, students will learn about principles and algorithms for turning
training data into effective automated predictions. We will cover:

- Representation, over-fitting, regularization, generalization, VC dimension;

- Clustering, classification, recommender problems, probabilistic modeling,
  reinforcement learning;

- On-line algorithms, support vector machines, and neural networks/deep
  learning.

Students will implement and experiment with the algorithms in several Python
projects designed for different practical applications.

# Global Health Informatics to Improve Quality of Care

- Instructor: [MIT (Massachusetts Institute of
  Technology)](https://www.mit.edu/)
- Publisher: [EdX](https://www.edx.org/)
- Link:
  <https://www.edx.org/course/global-health-informatics-to-improve-quality-of-ca>
- Price: \$49
- Time: 2-3 hours / week, 13 weeks, 39 hours, 1.5 ECTS

Disease has no respect for country borders and increased global travel has
fueled the spread of infectious disease, as evidenced by the Ebola virus
epidemic. Chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease, initially
confined to the developed world, now exist side by side with malnutrition in
low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Global warming is widening the
endemicity of vector-borne diseases.

In this course, we will explore ways to leverage information technology to
combat disease and promote health, especially in resource-constrained settings.
Technology is a driving force that sweeps across nations even faster than
disease and with the spread of mobile phones, which bring computational power
and data to our fingertips, new paradigms in tracking and battling disease have
been discovered.

This course will explore innovations in information systems in developing
countries, and focus not only on the importance of technology, but also on
broader issues necessary for its success, such as quality improvement, project
management, and leadership skills. Ultimately, health care delivery systems
require fundamental and sound operations, such as physical infrastructure and
supply-chain management, to deliver high-quality care. Technology is simply a
tool to help facilitate this process.

The quality of care theme is critical to this course. The first step
stakeholders in health systems should focus on prior to introducing an
innovation is to establish a culture of quality improvement and patient safety.
An information system can then play a facilitative role by enabling care
coordination, tracking processes and outcomes, informing decision making, and
fostering learning through data analysis.

An information system without an accompanying organizational transformation
risks reinforcing the same failed processes. Using technology to improve access
to care without any other quality improvement elements will yield the same and
not necessarily better results, but more of them. Innovations need to address
gaps in quality and demonstrate improvement in health outcomes, otherwise they
won’t sustain or scale.

Lastly, we will discuss our attempts to leverage troves of data to define best
practice and how we must keep the patient perspective and health at the center
of everything we do.

This course is targeted toward individuals interested in designing or
implementing a health information and communication technology (ICT) solution in
the developing world. Implementing a health information technology project
requires mulTimeisciplinary teams. Thus, with this course, we hope to bring
together individuals from a variety of disciplines—computer science, medicine,
engineering, public health, policy, and business.

# Automata Theory

- Instructor: [Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu/)
- Publisher: [EdX](https://www.edx.org/)
- Link: <https://www.edx.org/course/automata-theory>
- Price: \$129
- [Automata Theory](https://www.edx.org/course/automata-theory)Time: 5-10
  hours / week, 7 weeks, 70 hours, 2.5 ECTS

We begin with a study of finite automata and the languages they can define (the
so-called "regular languages." Topics include deterministic and nondeterministic
automata, regular expressions, and the equivalence of these language-defining
mechanisms. We also look at closure properties of the regular languages, e.g.,
the fact that the union of two regular languages is also a regular language. We
consider decision properties of regular languages, e.g., the fact that there is
an algorithm to tell whether or not the language defined by two finite automata
are the same language. Finally, we see the pumping lemma for regular languages
-- a way of proving that certain languages are not regular languages.

Our second topic is context-free grammars and their languages. We learn about
parse trees and follow a pattern similar to that for finite automata: closure
properties, decision properties, and a pumping lemma for context-free languages.
We also introduce the pushdown automaton, whose nondeterministic version is
equivalent in language-defining power to context-free grammars.

Next, we introduce the Turing machine, a kind of automaton that can define all
the languages that can reasonably be said to be definable by any sort of
computing device (the so-called "recursively enumerable languages"). We shall
learn how "problems" (mathematical questions) can be expressed as languages.
That lets us define problems to be "decidable" if their language can be defined
by a Turing machine and "undecidable" if not. We shall see some basic
undecidable problems, for example, it is undecidable whether the intersection of
two context-free languages is empty.

Last, we look at the theory of intractable problems. These are problems that,
while they are decidable, have almost certainly no algorithm that runs in time
less than some exponential function of the size of their input. We meet the
NP-complete problems, a large class of intractable problems. This class includes
many of the hard combinatorial problems that have been assumed for decades or
even centuries to require exponential time, and we learn that either none or all
of these problems have polynomial-time algorithms. A common example of an
NP-complete problem is SAT, the question of whether a Boolean expression has a
truth-assignment to its variables that makes the expression itself true.

- Link: <https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning>
- Price: \$49
- Time: 52 hours, 2 ECTS

Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being
explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us
self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a
vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning is so
pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing
it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress towards
human-level AI. In this class, you will learn about the most effective machine
learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting them to
work for yourself. More importantly, you'll learn about not only the theoretical
underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical know-how needed to
quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new problems. Finally, you'll
learn about some of Silicon Valley's best practices in innovation as it pertains
to machine learning and AI.

This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and
statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning
(parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural
networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction,
recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in machine learning
(bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). The
course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that
you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots
(perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer
vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.
