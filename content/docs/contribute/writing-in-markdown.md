# ***UNFINISHED***

This basically needs to copy the [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) page from Github but for our purposes on the website.

## Examples of markdown
### This is a third tier heading
| First row item               | Another one!                  |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| This is some content, though | Even more! When will it stop? |

I can write code like this:
```
# This is a code block
WriteBlogPost(new DateTime(DateTime.now()));
```
...though I might want to write other stuff as well. Maybe even [link to some cool stuff](https://github.com/AUcogseers/CogSite/tree/master/content). Or possibly have an image in my cool blog post:

But there's also just these normal awesome text formatting things:
- [x] *This is italicized*
- [x] **This is something else**
- [ ] Oh my, there's also a list in the middle of it all
- [ ] with checkmarks!
### Here's another major point
But I never planned this far so maybe I'll just link to the [markdown post...](writing-in-markdown)
