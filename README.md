# CogSite

Content for the Website of Cognitive Science Students at Aarhus University.

## ANNOUNCEMENTS
A1: Added TODO tasks - refer to those to choose a random task you want to take up 

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

You can host the site locally by running the HostSiteLocally.Rmd, after what, you can 
edit the website's content and see all changes made dynamically. Additionally, you 
can download `hugo-extended` with `choco install hugo-extended` if you have 
`chocolatey` downloaded. Then it's possible to use `hugo server` in the root 
folder and the website is hosted on port 1313 (by default).

## Current state

The technical elements are basically finished. The basic architecture is ready.

Some sub-pages under "reinforced learning" and "the data frame" still needs to 
be created but beyond that, they are mostly created (from the CogSite SideStruktur document)
