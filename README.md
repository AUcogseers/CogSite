# CogSite

Content for the Website of Cognitive Science Students at Aarhus University.

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

You can host the site locally by running the HostSiteLocally.Rmd, after what, you can edit the website's content and see all changes made dynamically. Additionally, you can download `hugo-extended` with `choco install hugo-extended` if you have `chocolatey` downloaded. Then it's possible to use `hugo server` in the root folder and the website is hosted on port 1313 (by default).
